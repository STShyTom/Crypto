# Visualisation de donn√©es personnelles de la plateforme YouTube

# Description
This project was carried out as part of the optional [Data Vizualization](https://lyondataviz.github.io/teaching/lyon1-m2/2024/) course of the Master Informatique IA of the Claude Bernard - Lyon 1 university. It aims to visualize the personal data of the YouTube platform of each group member. For this, we used the data provided by Google Takeout and formatted it using Python scripts. Then, we used the D3.js library to create the visualizations.

The visualizations made include:
 - Curves of the number of videos viewed over time
 - Bars of the viewing time according to the time of the day
 - Radar and donut charts to visualize the categories of videos viewed
 - A chord diagram to visualize the videos in common between the group members
